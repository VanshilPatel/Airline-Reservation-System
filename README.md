# Airline-Reservation-System

# The airline reservation system project using DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) linked list is a software application that allows users to book flights, manage reservations, and view flight schedules. 

The linked list data structure provides a flexible and dynamic way to store and manipulate data in memory. In the airline reservation system project, each node in the linked list represents a flight, and contains information such as flight number, departure and arrival time, and available seats. When a user searches for a flight, the system traverses the linked list to find flights that match the search criteria.
